# Context of the project
The brief is made up of two parts, a question part and a second practice part attached to the sentiment analysis brief (https://simplonline.co/briefs/687708b5-17ff-45a3-8934-6de9088fdd76)

In addition to this, you need to know more about it.

++ Questions (embed an answer file in your sentiment analysis project git): ++

### What is HTTP?
* HTTP stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol. The communication between client computers and web servers is done by sending **HTTP Requests** and receiving **HTTP Responses**

### What is an API?
* An API is a set of definitions and protocols for building and integrating application software. API stands for **Application Programming Interface**.

APIs let your product or service communicate with other products and services without having to know how they’re implemented. This can simplify app development, saving time and money. When you’re designing new tools and products—or managing existing ones—APIs give you flexibility; simplify design, administration, and use; and provide opportunities for innovation.

### What is the specificity of REST APIs?

* What is a URI, an endpoint, an operation?

* What can be found in the documentation of a rest API?

* Use Postman to make a 3 request on the public API of your choice. Share the requests as well as the answers.

++ Application: ++

* realize a REST API using fast API which for a certain sentence returns the prediction of the sentiment

* publish your application online.
